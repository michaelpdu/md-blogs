## Biometrics and Algorithm

### Behavioral Biometric

#### Keystroke Dynamic

[Comparing Anomaly-Detection Algorithms for Keystroke Dynamics](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxion/pubs/KillourhyMaxion09.pdf), K. Killourhy and R. Maxion, 2009

In this paper, the author published the results of different classification algorithms, along with the benchmark DSN dataset.

[Keystroke Biometrics Ongoing Competition](https://www.idiap.ch/~aanjos/papers/ieee-access-2016.pdf), A. Morales, et al, 2016

The current state of the art for the classifiers is represented by the Keystrokes Biometrices Ongoing Competition (KBOC)

[Robust Keystroke Biometric Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.09075.pdf), J. V. Monaco, 2016

[Code for submissions to the Keystroke Biometrics Ongoing Competition](https://github.com/vmonaco/kboc), J. V. Monaco, 2017 

Winner of the competition and his code

#### Touchscreen Swipe

[Biometric Authentication Based on Touchscreen Swipe Patterns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017316000621), M. Antal and L. Z. Szabo, 2016

Antal et al. recently published a comprehensive analysis of many classifiers, along with a standard dataset that had features extracted from swipes on an Android platform.

## Adversarial Biometrics
